  - Saving JSON files is easy, all you need to do is make a level, press the button, and it will save the .json file on your computer. This can be used on the main menu, you will be able to load it, and it will be in the level list (if it is has valid map data).
 
# Main Menu
## There are three menus. Play Levels, Level Editor, and Settings.
- Play Levels gives many complete pre-made levels made by the developer to play.

Level Editor gives buttons to create a new level, and to load a .json. 

- Loading a .json file is easy, when you have a valid .json file with valid map data, it will appear in the level list.
-  When selecting the newly added level, two options will appear: Play, and Edit.
-  - Play will load the level in gameplay.
   - Edit will open the editor with the level automatically loaded.
